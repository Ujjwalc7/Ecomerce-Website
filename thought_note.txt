This is the Part 1 â€“ Front end Development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript)
of the ecommerce project.

In this project, I have created all the pages and and their sub categories
pages that is metioned in problem statement.

All the pages are responsive and the header and footer are dynamically
injected into the pages as metioned in problem statement.

For the header, footer, navbar and the slider in each pages I have created 
javascript components (components folder) that are dynamically injected into the pages which take
some properties that are passed in the parameters from where the are invoked to save time and code less.

There is logo folder containing the logo image of the application.

There is a pages folder containing all the pages that are rendered in the browser.
each folder in the pages folder contains a JS file, a HTML file and a CSS file where needed.


At last there is a product-links folder containing all the product-links of the application.

It has a featured-product folder containing featuredProduct.js javascript array of objects data which has
the products id, name, image, price and description. This array is exported and is 
imported in the index.js file to render the products dynamically.

It has the folder footer-links and navbar-links containing footerLinks.js file and navbarLinks.js file
that contains all the product links that is in an array of objects format which is also exported and 
imported in the footer and navbar component to render the links dynamically in the browser.

Then it has all the mens-product, womens-products and kids-products folder containing all the data of products
of their respective categories in array of objects format which is also exported and imported in the pages folder
in the .js file of men, women and kid to render the data dynamically in the browser.
